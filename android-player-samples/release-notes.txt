    * The Brightcove SDK and its plugins have been updated to use version 4.10.+
      This version has now support for Android TV.
      Note that you are required to add <category android:name="android.intent.category.LEANBACK_LAUNCHER"/>
      as an intent filter category for your Main Activity, so that your app appears in the Android TV home screen.

      Along with this version, the ExoPlayer was updated to 1.5.9

  brightcove-exoplayer/ID3SampleApp changes:

    * The ExoPlayerVideoDisplayComponent.Id3MetadataListener() has changed, so now instead of
      receiving a map on the onId3Metadata callback, you'll get a List<Id3Frame>.
      The TxxxMetadata does not exist anymore.

Version 4.6.6:

  brightcove-exoplayer/WidevineModularSampleApp known issues:

    * Widevine Modular Playback Issue:

      Testing has uncovered a playback issue in the Widevine Modular
      integration for the Brightcove Android Player SDK that prevents
      playback in most cases. We are actively working on a solution to
      be released as soon as possible. Those using Brightcove
      ExoPlayer instead of the Widevine plugin should continue to use
      the Android Native Player SDK version 4.6.4.
